# Database-Management-System
My DBMS, built from scratch inside of two weeks for my database class.

This system requires MySQL Workbench to properly connect over a localized server, as well as a specific SQL Script to be run and data to be input.
This information will be placed into the file once I have instructor permission for those pieces.


UPDATE: 9/23/15 Database creation script added. includes default user login:
Username: root
Password: admin

Please note: default settings for a local ODBC are required to successfully connect DBMS to server!
